<!--Here, I wrote my opinions on the state of racism-->
  <p class="blurb">
Racism is discrimination or prejudice against another person or group of people based on their ethnicity or race, usually a minority. Racism can be shown through hate crimes, hate speech, as well as less bold actions, such as microaggressions. It can be experienced by people in the workplace, schools, and even out in the general public. The prejudice occurs all around the world to varying races and ethnicities and in America, it is, evidently, systemic. Racist actions can hurt people mentally and physically, and some of those wounds cannot be healed; the effects can remain, whether visible or invisible, for life. And presently, racism is still very prevalent and will unfortunately remain that way unless everyone makes a collective change.<strong> Forge a future that is worth living in.</strong>
