<p class="about">
  Hello, I am Yu Ying and I am a Chinese person living in the United States during the Covid-19 pandemic. Throughout the course of the year, I witnessed first hand the hate received in the U.S. by Asians and all other minorities alike and was disgusted and disappointed at the state of our country. I think everyone, including myself, felt very powerless regarding the appalling treatment toward people of color. So now, just like hundreds of well-meaning others, I am attempting to further raise awareness via the power of the internet.
